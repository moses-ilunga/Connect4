Step One - Planning

what HTML would be useful for the game board itself?
- Table (Row and Columns)
- Div (adding for adding and removing colors)

how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
- By using a div 

in the JavaScript, what would be a good structure for the in-memory game board?

- 2D Array data structure: 7 indexed arrays, 6 arrays = board array let
	- TR and TD elements
	- TR = Index Array
	- TD = 6 arrays

- add a div element in specified row/column of the tr element with add event listener
- have a const variable called blue
- have a const variable called red
- select the table element with queryselector and put it in a cost variable called table
- select the div element using getelementby id and name it colorDiv. Usimg getelemntbyid because I will be appending
- 

what might the flow of the game be?
